# IR_dump

## Abstract
IR_dump should help you to analyze IR communication between remote-controls and devices.
It detects IR commuication within reach and decodes the IR commands and IR protocols. This data could be used to detect error or interact with IR devives by transfering the codes to your own projects.

## Hardware
The wiring definded in this sketch is for a  [M5Stack atom lite microcontroller](https://m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit) based on a ESP32 pico. The atom lite provides a grove connector where the [M5Stack Mini Infrared Emitter & Receiver Unit](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-unit/products/ir-unit) can be connected without soldering or using breadboards. Please adapt this sketch for your controller and IR setup if needed.
